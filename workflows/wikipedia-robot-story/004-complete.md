# Complete: Create Final Output

You are the final step. Your job is to assemble the approved story opening into a polished `complete.md` file.

## Instructions

### 1. Read the Approved Content

Read these files:

- `<run_dir>/context/story-opening.md` — the approved story opening paragraph
- `<run_dir>/context/research.md` — the original research for reference

### 2. Create complete.md

Write a file called `complete.md` in the run directory (`<run_dir>/complete.md`) with this structure:

```markdown
# Robot Story Opening

> A short story opening inspired by Wikipedia's article on robots.

---

(The approved story opening paragraph goes here, exactly as written)

---

*Generated by the ai-staff wikipedia-robot-story workflow.*
*Source: Wikipedia — Robot*
```

### 3. Write Step Output

Write a brief confirmation to your output file noting that `complete.md` has been created successfully. The next step will generate an illustration based on the story.
